# roblox-acc-details
get a roblox user's public details (rap, last online, creation date, description, etc)

if you haven't already, reinstall python and install python on windows 10 and set to path
you can follow this tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTUlp6L2zkw

after you have done that and are sure you did everything correctly, run the 'installer.bat', that will install all the python modules i used in order to make the program.
once all of it installed, it should say the download is done. then go ahead and launch 'rac.py' and type in the roblox username you want to lookup (can be past users too)

xq#4300 if you have any questions
